There are a number of conditions that , whilst preventable , can be acquired in hospitals and have an adverse effect on a patients morbidity and / or involve substantial financial cost to the hospital . Analysis of these conditions is currently difficult as it is not always known whether a condition has been acquired during the patients stay or was present at the time of admission to the hospital . If introduced a Present on admission flag could enable identification of conditions that were acquired by patients during their stay and those that existed prior to admission . This would enable better analysis of these conditions , helping to attribute the condition to the appropriate timeframe and in turn identify good practice . The Health and Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) is working with key stakeholders , including the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges ( AoMRC ) , Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) and Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) to define a candidate list of Present on Admission conditions and associated guidance . We are keen to hear from stakeholders , particularly clinicians and healthcare specialists . The consultation has now been extended until Sunday 28 July to enable as wide a range of stakeholders to respond as possible . "`

GPSoC has successfully delivered a flexible mechanism for contracting for GP clinical IT systems in GP practices since 2007 and 81 per cent of practices currently use a system provided through the framework . GP clinical IT systems are key to collecting and sharing patient data to support clinical care . They also provide access to national services including Choose and Book , the Electronic Prescription Service , Summary Care Records and GP2GP electronic transfer of patient records . The extension was arranged by the GPSoC team , now part of the Health and Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) . As well as being the trusted source of data and information relating to health and care , HSCIC supports the delivery of IT infrastructure , information systems and standards to ensure information flows efficiently and securely across the health and social care system to improve patient outcomes . The HSCIC was established as an Executive Non - Departmental Public Body on 1st April . In addition to working on the extension , the GPSoC team has also been consulting widely with both GP representatives and the supplier community on new contracting arrangements to support the delivery of GP clinical IT systems in the future . NHS England is also heavily involved in this work , as the new sponsor of GPSoC ."`
